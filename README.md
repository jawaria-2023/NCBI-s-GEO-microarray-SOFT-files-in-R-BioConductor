# NCBI-s-GEO-microarray-SOFT-files-in-R-BioConductor

This script guides the loading of GEO SOFT format microarray data from the NCBI-hosted Gene Expression Omnibus database into R/BioConductor. It covers different types of files (GPL, GSM, GSE, GDS), emphasizes GDS for expression levels, and introduces the prominent GEOquery parser by Sean Davis. The discussion includes converting a GEO DataSet (GDS) file into an exprSet object and loading GEO Platform annotation (GPL) files. In the MOAC Module 5 assignment, manual data sanitization was employed for R loading, but the script explores more elegant solutions, highlighting the efficiency of the GEOquery parser by Sean Davis, released around December 2005.
